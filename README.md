# **Capstone Project: Movie Analysis at Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp**

## **Project Overview**
Welcome to the repository for my Capstone Project, completed during the Lux Academy and DSEA 5-Week Bootcamp Program. This project involves an in-depth exploration and analysis of movie data, culminating in the creation of insightful dashboards using Power BI.

### **Repository Contents**
- **Datasets Folder:** 
  - Contains 8 datasets derived from the analysis process. These datasets were used to create the Power BI dashboards.
  - **Files:**
    - `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`
    - `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`
    - Additional processed datasets based on the analysis.

- **Movie Analysis.ipynb:** 
  - A Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization. 
  - This notebook documents the entire analysis process, from data loading to generating insights.

- **Movie Analysis Dashboards.pbix:** 
  - A Power BI file containing all the dashboards created during the project. 
  - These dashboards visually represent key insights and trends in the movie industry.

### **Datasets**
- The primary datasets, `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` and `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`, were sourced from Kaggle. 
- They contain detailed information about movies, including metadata, cast, crew, and ratings.
- The other datasets in the folder are outputs from the analysis and transformations performed in the Jupyter Notebook.

### **Analysis and Visualization**
- **Movie Analysis.ipynb** notebook includes:
  - **Data Exploration:** 
    - Understanding the structure, data types, and summary statistics of the datasets.
  - **Data Cleaning:** 
    - Addressing missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
  - **Visualization:** 
    - Generating plots to uncover insights into movie data, such as genre trends, popularity over time, and box office performance.

- **Movie Analysis Dashboards.pbix** file contains several dashboards created in Power BI, including:
  - **Genre Trends Over the Years**
  - **Top Directors and Actors**
  - **Ratings vs. Box Office Performance**
  - **Insights on Movie Budgets and Revenues**

## **How to Use**
### **View the Jupyter Notebook:**
- Open the `Movie Analysis.ipynb` file to explore the code and analysis performed on the datasets.
- You can run this notebook on your local machine or view it using any Jupyter notebook viewer.

### **Explore the Power BI Dashboards:**
- Download and open the `Movie Analysis Dashboards.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
- Navigate through the different dashboards to explore the insights derived from the movie data.

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of movie data, highlighting key trends and insights in the movie industry. The dashboards created using Power BI offer a visual summary of the data, making it easier to understand and communicate findings.
